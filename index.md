## About Me
My name is Donggang Jia. I received my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at [The University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk) in 2020. Advised by Professor [Xiaohao Cai](https://sites.google.com/site/welcome2xhcai/), I completed my master thesis in medical image segmentation. Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology at [The University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn) in 2019.

## Research Interests
Medical Imaging, Computer Vision and Deep Learning.


## Recent

I spent summer 2020 at [Deepwise](http://www.deepwise.com) as a machine learning intern. My work was mainly on aortic dissection detection.
